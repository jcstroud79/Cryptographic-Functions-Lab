# Cryptogtaphic Functions Lab
In this lab, I demonstrated mastery of fundamental cryptographic systems and concepts. I learned how the hash of a file can be used to uniquely identify its contents. I also learned 
how to generate a cryptographic signature using public key encryption, and how to use cryptographic signature validation to confirm file content integrity and origination. Building 
upon this foundational knowledge, I then learned the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, how to encrypt, transmit, and decrypt encrypted data, and the value of 
encryption for data at rest as part data loss prevention (DLP).

## Lab Objectives:
- Understand how the hash of a file can be used to uniquely identify its contents
- Create a cryptographic signature using a public key encryption algorithm
- Use cryptographic signature validation to confirm content integrity and originator validity
- Demonstrate the value of encryption for data at rest as a means to protect stored data as part of a data loss prevention (DLP) strategy
- Compare and contrast symmetric versus asymmetric encryption
- Understand decryption of data by an authorized or intended recipient with a sole private key
- Perform encryption, transport, and decryption of a sensitive file

## Skills Learned
- Perform file validation using file hashes
- Perform file certification using digital signatures
- Perform signature analysis to determine authenticity and non-repudiation
- Perform review of malware samples using hashes
- Perform symmetric encryption analysis
- Perform asymmetric encryption analysis
- Perform file encryption and decryption

## Steps
This lab was completed as part of the SANS Institute course SEC401: Security Essentials - Network, Endpoint, and Cloud. I HIGHLY recommend this course!
